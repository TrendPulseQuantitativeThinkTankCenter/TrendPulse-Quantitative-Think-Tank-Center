The TrendPulse Quantitative Think Tank Center, established in 2015, is a new type of quantitative investment technology organization focused on the integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Since its inception, the TrendPulse Think Tank Center has been committed to providing global investors with precise and efficient investment tools and strategy solutions through deep integration of technological innovation and market demand. In 2017, the TrendPulse Quantitative Think Tank Center launched its core quantitative trading system, Robovis, an intelligent investment platform driven by cutting-edge technology.

The development of Robovis was personally led by Dr. Johnathan Walker, a renowned expert in blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. Robovis seamlessly integrates blockchain technology with quantitative systems, introducing a universal token as a bridge. This not only realizes the intelligence of investment strategies but also builds a community ecosystem for long-term, harmonious interaction with users. As one of TrendPulse Quantitative Think Tank Center's core achievements, Robovis has undergone multiple stages of development and optimization over the past few years:

2017: The system was established and the core algorithm design for the initial version was completed.
2019: The system underwent a comprehensive upgrade, optimizing the investment strategy library and data processing capabilities.
2021: The core functionality of Robovis was improved, enabling it to handle global multi-market and multi-asset investments.
2023: After multiple rounds of internal testing and stress testing, the systemâ€™s functionality became stable, demonstrating excellent performance.
2025: Robovis will undergo market practical testing and is scheduled to be officially launched for sale in September.
Currently, the market valuation of TrendPulse Quantitative Think Tank Center has reached $500 million, showcasing its leading position and tremendous potential within the industry. According to the think tank's development plan, its goal is to increase its market valuation to $3 billion within the next few years. At that point, TrendPulse Quantitative Think Tank Center aims to seek acquisition by a tech giant with a valuation of $5 billion, creating exceptional returns for its shareholders.

TrendPulse Quantitative Think Tank Center not only focuses on technology development but also places great importance on investment education. Through investment education courses and user training, the think tank imparts quantitative investment concepts and technical applications to a wide range of investors, helping them better utilize Robovis to achieve asset appreciation. This initiative has not only deepened users' trust in the think tank but also further strengthened Robovis's core competitiveness in the market.

In terms of building user communities, TrendPulse Quantitative Think Tank Center actively creates an open, transparent, and efficient interactive platform. Through the design of universal tokens, users can participate in decision-making, share profits, and promote system optimization within the community. This two-way interaction model enhances user engagement and lays a solid foundation for the think tank's long-term development.

Looking ahead, TrendPulse Quantitative Think Tank Center will continue to adhere to the philosophy of combining technology-driven and market-oriented approaches, constantly innovating to help investors achieve long-term, steady returns in a complex financial environment. With Robovis about to be launched, TrendPulse Quantitative Think Tank Center is confident it will achieve even greater breakthroughs and set a new benchmark in the field of quantitative investment.
